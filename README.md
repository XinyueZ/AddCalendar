# klint support

The project uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.
Here's how to configure it for use with Android Studio (instructions adapted
from the ktlint [README](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md)):

- Close Android Studio if it's open

- Download ktlint:

  `curl -sSLO https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/releases/download/0.34.2/ktlint && chmod a+x ktlint`

- Inside the project root directory run:

  `ktlint --apply-to-idea-project --android`

- Remove ktlint if desired:

  `rm ktlint`

- Start Android Studio
